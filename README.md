# Strasburg-French-Film-Festival
For this volunteer experience, I was assigned to build a website for the French Film Festival organized by the Shenandoah Film Collaborative.
In collaboration with the art director and founder, we are able to design the website with responsiveness for all device sizes to match the requirements for the project.


### Technology used:
- Avada Theme Builder for complex grid layout design.
- HubSpot and MailChimp for capturing leads and user data.
